My name is Stacy and here's my story: born and raised in the small piece of land that connects the Americas, Panama. Flew to the US on 2013 to obtain my B.S. in Computer Engineering and I'm now currently working towards my M.S. in Engineering Management at the same school, University of South Florida. 

Things that I love: running, eating, sleeping (I can take naps that last over 3 hours, I know, super talented), my dog (an Australian Shepherd named Odin), and keeping busy (I love starting self projects, be it cleaning and exploring a dataset I found interesting or doing a spring cleaning of the house during winter). 

Things I don't love: ketchup (I know, I'm weird), long flights on the middle seat, long lines at public restrooms (the main downside of being a girl, we're better on every other aspect tho).
