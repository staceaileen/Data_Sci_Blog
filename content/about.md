My name is Stacy Kam and I was born a raised in Panama City, Panama. I went to Florida to obtain my undergrad degree on Computer Engineering at University of South Florida, and am continuing my studies with a Master's of Science in Engineering Management. 

I aspire to be a data scientist or a data analyst. I love everything from the tidy code lines that decipher messy dataframes to making it look pretty on a dashboard.
